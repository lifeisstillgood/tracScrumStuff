tracTools
=========

tracTools - I have recently been required to use `Trac <trac.edgewall.org>`_ 
at work and needed to get a grip on running a Scrum with Trac.  I know there are a lot of plugins out there, but understanding comes from really using.

So I have put this collection of tools together - they are barely usable by me, but I hope they will grow up as I have time to improve them.

I have two main areas of development - burndown charting, and managing SVN integration. The burndown is OK, but needs to be moved to a plugin not a standalone generator.  However the SVN integration is showing some promise - it is predicated on using the `svnmerge <>`_ tool and then monitors and parses svn logs and matches them up to tickets - so we can tell what changesets are in what tickets, and how to merge, rollback and see what is in what branch, and what is missing.

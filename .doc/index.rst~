   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ciotools's documentation!
====================================

CIOTools is an attempt to put into one place, examples, thoughts and 
working code that support the day to day work of an IT manager.  It is 
I suppose the code-companion to `The IT managers cookbook <http://itmanagerscookbook>`_.
